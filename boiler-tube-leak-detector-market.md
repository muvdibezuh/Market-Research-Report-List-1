<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Tube Leak Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Airborne Sensor</li><li>Structure Borne Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Boiler Tube Leak Detector market features two main types: Airborne Sensors and Structure Borne Sensors. Airborne Sensors detect leaks by analyzing sound waves traveling through the air, identifying the high-frequency noise generated by escaping steam or gases. In contrast, Structure Borne Sensors monitor vibrations and other mechanical signals transmitted through the boiler structure itself, effectively pinpointing leaks based on changes in the physical integrity of the equipment. Both technologies enhance maintenance efficiency and reduce operational risks in boiler systems.</p></p>
