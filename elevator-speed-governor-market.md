<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elevator Speed Governor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Type</li><li>Resonance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Elevator Speed Governor market comprises primarily two types: centrifugal and resonance governors. Centrifugal governors utilize mechanical inertia to control elevator speed, engaging when the cabin exceeds a predetermined velocity, ensuring safety and preventing free fall. In contrast, resonance type governors use oscillation principles, providing precise speed control by detecting variations in motion. Both types are critical for maintaining elevator safety and performance, with applications varying based on design preferences, operational environments, and regulatory requirements.</p></p>
